Key Milestones and Standards Evolution:

| Year  | Milestone                                                                 | Details                                                                                                  |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1983  | Berkeley Line Printer Daemon (lpd) introduced with BSD Unix               | Traditional UNIX printing with lpr, lpq, lprm commands; Simple queue-based printing system               |
| 1988  | System V printing commands (lp, lpstat, cancel) introduced                | Alternative command set to Berkeley commands; Different syntax but similar functionality                 |
| 1990s | PostScript becomes dominant page description language                     | Introduction of PostScript Printer Description (PPD) files; Standardized printer capability descriptions |
| 1997  | Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) 1.0 specification released               | Network-based printing standard; HTTP-based communication protocol                                       |
| 1999  | Common Unix Printing System (CUPS) 1.0 released by Easy Software Products | Modern replacement for traditional lpd systems; IPP-based architecture with web interface                |
| 2002  | CUPS 1.1 adds support for printer classes and authentication              | Enhanced security features; Better network printer support                                               |
| 2007  | Apple acquires CUPS and Easy Software Products                            | Becomes default printing system for macOS; Continued development for Linux distributions                 |
| 2012  | Ubuntu adopts CUPS as default printing system                             | Replaces older GNOME printing architecture; Integration with Unity desktop environment                   |
| 2014  | IPP Everywhere standard introduced                                        | Driverless printing specification; Self-describing printers via IPP attributes                           |
| 2017  | CUPS 2.2 adds full IPP Everywhere support                                 | Native driverless printing capabilities; Automatic printer discovery and setup                           |
| 2019  | OpenPrinting takes over CUPS development from Apple                       | Community-driven development model; Focus on Linux and open-source ecosystems                            |
| 2020  | IPP 2.0 and PWG standards mature                                          | Enhanced security (IPP over HTTPS); Better mobile and cloud printing support                             |
| 2023  | CUPS 3.0 development begins                                               | Complete rewrite focusing on driverless printing; Elimination of legacy PPD file dependencies            |
